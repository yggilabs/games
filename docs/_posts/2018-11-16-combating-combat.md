# Combating Combat: Better Adventuring Days by Spending All Your Resources.

## A Case for Spending All Your Resources
Issues
* Most groups have one one or two encounters per day.
* Combat takes a long time.
* Some combat isn't very important to the narrative.
* Non combat encounters are vaguely defined.

Goals
* Get through less important combats faster.
* Increase the number of encounters per day.
* Reward players for engaging with non combat mechanics.
* Make use of under utilized character details.
* Don't break the game, use the existing rules. Provide clarification not contradiction.
* Don't break the characters, a character in this game can play in another game or come back without issue

## When to Use These Rules

If the encounter is covered by the combat rules but, its not important or interesting enough to spend much time on.

> **Simplified Combat Encounters**
> 
> Your group might use these rules for the situation when your
> characters run into another group of goblins. Your group may not want
> to go through multiple rounds of combat with yet another group of
> goblins but, they are valuable experience and possibly a large part of
> adventuring in monster infested lands. Using these rules, a group can
> gain the experience points and narration from this encounter with just
> a few rolls and perhaps, a few lost hit dice.

If you want to provide some rules structure to the encounters that aren't covered by the combat rules.

> **Non-Combat Encounters**
> 
> Additionally, these rules let your group create rewarding encounters
> out of situations which currently lack rules guidance. This can give
> structure to encounters ranging from parleying with a pirate captain
> to a gang heist gone sideways.

## Combating Combat

At the beginning of a session make note of **encounter tier**, **encounter DC** and **encounter challenge** (See **Glossary**). The first step of running an encounter using these rules  is for the DM to **Frame** the scene. Then, the players **Act** until they overcome the challenge [or leave]. Finally, the DM will **Reward** characters for the encounter.


### Frame

As the DM using these rules, your main job in setting up an encounter is to frame the scene. Some details are required just to understand the scenario. However, think about the points of strength and weakness present in your encounter. Be sure to describe at least one detail which may be used used advantageously for the players or may cause them some amount of disadvantage if not handled properly.

> **Show! Don't Tell** 
> 
> Instead of saying, "You are eating dinner with Duke Ellington III. You
> have disadvantage on diplomacy checks with The Duke because you got
> into a bar fight with his cousin last night. What do you do?" Try
> something like, "As you sit down to dinner with Duke Ellington III, a
> servant enters and begins to whisper in his ear. His eyes shift to
> Clara and grow cold for a moment despite his jovial mien. 'I'm so glad
> you could join me for dinner.' He offers courteously. What do you do?"
> 
> If a detail is not important enough to show then its not important
> enough to impose advantage or disadvantage.

### Act

Player's will each take turns attempting to overcome the encounter. Give players with higher relevant ability scores the option of going first. Monsters and NPCs do not get any turns. On each player's turn they will do the following:

1. Answer these questions.
	* What are you doing?
	* How does that help?

> **Validating Actions**
>
> The DM determines if the *what* and *how* are appropriate to the task
> at hand . Throwing 10g at an angry wyvern *probably* won't calm it
> down.

2. Based on your answers, the work with DM to determine an appropriate ability to test and a resource to put at stake.

> **Choosing Resources**
> 
> The DM may give a resource category and allow the player to choose
> unless a specific resource is called for. Higher tier resources may be
> substituted for lower tier resources. See
> **Appendix: Expendable Resources** for details.


> **Limiting Resources**
> 
> The DM may cap the effect of actions by limiting the resource tier.
> [Maximum resource tier is the same as **encounter tier**]

3. Make the appropriate check against the **encounter DC**. If the fiction demands advantage or disadvantage, apply it!
	* If you succeed on the check, reduce the **encounter challenge** by the tier of the resource  
	* If you do not succeed on the check by 5 or more, you lose the wagered resource. 

> **Tracking Resources**
> 
> Some lost resources may simply be kept track of by changing a number
> or crossing it out. Potions or Hit Dice are good examples of these
> types of resources. Reputations and the like can be a bit tricky, take
> good concise notes for these more abstract resources.

### Reward

Give experience, gold, treasure or, other rewards as defeating monster of CR equal to the highest level character in your party.

## Rundown 
(The party has been seeking out a rare book called *The Tome of Tones*. They have located it just in time to save their skins and are attempting to obtain it. The party consists of: Chief, 5th level warlock; Clara, 6th level bard; Rondo 5th level monk)

DM: Thanks to some well placed bribes, you have located *The Tome of Tones*. It resides in the library of your old friend at Ellington Estate. Its now early evening and there is clearly movement inside the house. You know he lives alone but, often has servants on hand. What do you do?

(The highest level player in this party is 6 and the party has 3 player characters. So, **encounter tier** is 2, **encounter DC** is 12 and, **encounter challenge** is 6)

Chief: I want to figure out where everyone is.

DM: Okay, what do you do?

Chief: I want to get eyes on Duke and the servants. I look in all the windows on the ground floor and I climb up to the second floor to get a look in there too.

DM: Are you being more sneaky or observant?

Chief: Sneaky.

DM: Okay, roll stealth and we'll put your station at stake. pick a tier.

Chief: Whats the difference between one and two here?

DM: One is, they see you and recognize you from somewhere but they can't quite place you, next time they see you they will figure it out. Two is, they remember meeting you when you were here before.

Chief: I'm gonna go with one.

Chief: My stealth is fourteen.

(**encounter challenge** is reduced by 1 down to 5, Chief loses station)

DM: You do your job, you see The Duke is his library reading and taking notes. There are two servants in the kitchen preparing dinner. However, while you are looking around one of the servants steps outside and catches a glimpse of the side of your face before you can get clear. What's everyone else up to?

Clara: I seduce him! I want him to leave the library and be distracted for a while.

DM: Okay, what do you do?

Clara: I pull out my lyre and stand outside the window and just start singing. loudly!

DM: Sounds like performance, wager something about your self.

Clara: If my innate talent isn't enough for him I will weave some magic in too. I will gamble a second level spell slot. Also, I'm using up a bardic inspiration on myself.

Clara: Nineteen performance.

(**encounter challenge** is reduced by 2 down to 3)

DM: You play your song and nothing happens for a time. Then you see him come out to the window scowling and he throws them open. You can see hes about to yell and then he looks down and recognizes you. His face lights up and smiles at you warmly. 

DM (The Duke): I'll be right down!

DM: A moment later you see him in the front door. 

DM (The Duke): Have you decided to take me up on that offer?

Clara: I was in the area and you are always going on about how great a cook Smithers is.

DM: So, the duke welcomes you in. I think he makes small talk and he brings you over to the dining room. He says he needs to make sure they prepare another serving and leaves you there to go to the kitchen. What about you Rondo?

Rondo: You said the window was open, I want to climb up there and look through all the books.

DM: Make an Investigation check. I seems like you are trying to be fast about this. climbing up the window and looking through the shelves. I think you should risk some ki. Since they are easy to recover three ki can count as a tier two resource.

Rondo: That's a 6.

(**encounter challenge** is not reduced, Rondo loses 3 ki)

DM: You gracefully vault up the side of the building and swiftly move around the room. But, you can't seem to figure out the sorting system so you are looking through each book one by one. It's takes way longer than you want but you eventually spot the book. Mark off the ki too. Lets go back to Clara to see if she bought you some time.

DM: As you sit down to dinner with Duke Ellington III, a servant enters and begins to whisper in his ear. His eyes shift to Clara and grow cold for a moment despite his jovial mien. 'I'm so glad you could join me for dinner.' He offers courteously. What do you do?

Clara: I mostly want to stall. So, make him think that he has a shot and just eat slowly.

DM: This is diplomacy but, at disadvantage. Pick some stuff to risk.

Clara: Gold. If this goes poorly I'll donate some money to his charity that turns orphans into buskers or whatever it is they do. I'll make it a hundred gold for tier two. And I'm using inspiration to cancel the disadvantage. And I'm weaving magic into my words with bardic inspiration.

Clara: Even without disadvantage I still rolled a one. So, it's only seventeen.

(**encounter challenge** is reduced by 2 down to 1)

DM: Sure, plus sixteen. Seems balanced. What are you doing Rondo?

Chief: I want to distract the people in the kitchen so dinner doesn't happen.

DM: How do you do that?

Chief: I will come to the door in disguise so they are too busy talking to me to cook. I will use disguise self. 

Clara: We only need a tier one by the way.

DM: Okay that's deception. I think you can risk your station again and upgrade it to the tier two result. But, I'll give you advantage if you use disguise self twice and tell me about two different disguises.

Rondo: Sure, I first come by as a mid summer solstice fireworks vendor. I'll use prestidigitation to give them a sample display. About 5 minutes later I come back in priest vestments. You know how normally the right side of the robe goes over the left side? Mine are the other way because I come from The Church of The Left-Handed One. I tell them about how everything they do is almost correct but also the exact opposite of correct.

DM: Wrong?

Chief: Yeah, but more ambiguous.

DM: Okay, just roll you have your advantage.

Chief: Thirteen.

(**encounter challenge** is reduced by 1 down to 0, challenge compete, Chief loses station)

DM: So, This whole thing definitely strikes them as weird. By the time you are wrapping up your second visit, one of them pieces it all together. I think the one that saw you earlier recognizes your voice and it triggers the memory. You see them walk out of the kitchen and towards the dining room. The one still talking to you just looks annoyed.

Chief: I thank them for their time. And get out of there as fast as I can without looking suspicious. Also, I hoot loudly.

DM: You both hear a loud hoot what do you do?

Rondo: I know what an owl hoot means. I grab the book and get the hell out of there. Ill dive out through the window and do that roll thing where I land in a crouch. Then, I run back to the safe house.

DM: Clara, after the hoot you hear one of the servants beckoning for The Duke in the other room. He looks a bit flustered and excuses himself. He walks out of the dining room. What do you do?

Clara: I open the window and climb out. Then I go home.

DM: There is a very beautiful window here but its more ornate than the others. It has stained glass around the edges. It doesn't appear to open like some of the others.

Clara: Like I said, I open the window by throwing a chair through it and climb out. Then I go home. I know what an owl hoot means.

DM: Cool. A flock of dire owls attack.
